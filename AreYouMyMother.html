			<h1><i>Are You My Mother?</i></h2>
		</font>
		<hr color=black>
		<font size="5"><b>Are You My Mother?</b> is a children's book by P. D. Eastman published by Random House
			Books for Young Readers on June 12, 1960 as part of its Beginner Books series. Based on a 2007 online
			poll,the National Education Association named the book one of its"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children.
			It was one of the "Top 100 Picture Books" of all time in a 2012 poll by School Library Journal.

				<h1><i>Plot summary</i></h2>
			</font>
			<hr color=black>
			<p>Are You My Mother? is the story about a hatchling bird. His mother, thinking her egg will stay in
				her nest where she left it, leaves her egg alone and flies off to find food. The baby bird hatches. He
				does
				not understand where his mother is so he goes to look for her. As he loses his ability to fly, he
				walks,
				and in his search, he asks a kitten, a hen, a dog, and a cow if they are his mother, but none of them
				are.
			</p>

			<p>Refusing to give up, he sees an old car, which he realizes certainly cannot be his mother. In
				desperation,
				the hatchling calls out to a boat and a plane (neither responds), and at last, climbs onto the teeth of
				an
				enormous power shovel. It belches "SNORT" from its exhaust stack, prompting the bird to cry, "You are
				not my mother! You are a Snort!" As the machine shudders and grinds into motion, he cannot escape.
				"I want my mother!" he shouts.</p>

			<p>At that moment, the Snort drops the hatchling into his nest, and his mother returns. The two are
				reunited, much to their delight, and the baby bird recounts to his mother the adventures he had looking
				for her.</p>
