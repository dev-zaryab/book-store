			<h1><i>The Linux Command Line</i></h2>
		</font>
		<hr color=black>
		<font size="5"><b>The Linux Command Line</b> is a family of free and open-source software
			operating systems built around the Linux kernel. Typically, Linux is packaged in a form known as a
			Linux distribution (or distro for short) for both desktop and server use. The defining component of a
			Linux distribution is the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17,
			1991, by Linus Torvalds.

			<p>Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture, but has
				since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system. Because of the dominance of
				the Linux kernel-based Android OS on smartphones, Linux has the largest installed base of all general-
				purpose operating systems. Linux is also the leading operating system on servers and other big
				iron systems such as mainframe computers, and the only OS used on TOP500 supercomputers (since
				November 2017, having before gradually eliminated all competitors). It is used by around 2.3%
				of desktop computers. The Chromebook, which runs the Linux kernel-based Chrome OS,
				dominates the US K�12 education market and represents nearly 20% of the sub-$300 notebook sales
				in the US. Linux also runs on embedded systems�devices whose operating system is typically built
				into the firmware and is highly tailored to the system. This includes TiVo and similar DVR devices,
				network routers, facility automation controls, televisions, video game consoles and smartwatches.
				Many smartphones and tablet computers run Android and other Linux derivatives.</p>

				<h1><i>History</i></h2>
			</font>
			<hr color=black>
			<b>Precursors</b>

			<p>Linus Torvalds, principal author of the Linux kernel
				The Unix operating system was conceived and implemented in 1969, at AT&T's Bell Laboratories in the
				United States by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Douglas McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna. First released in
				1971, Unix was written entirely in assembly language, as was common practice at the time. Later, in a
				key pioneering approach in 1973, it was rewritten in the C programming language by Dennis Ritchie
				(with the exception of some hardware and I/O routines). The availability of a high-level language
				implementation of Unix made its porting to different computer platforms easier.</p>

			<p>Due to an earlier antitrust case forbidding it from entering the computer business, AT&T was
				required to license the operating system's source code to anyone who asked. As a result, Unix grew
				quickly and became widely adopted by academic institutions and businesses. In 1984, AT&T divested
				itself of Bell Labs; freed of the legal obligation requiring free licensing, Bell Labs began selling
				Unix as
				a proprietary product, where users weren't legally allowed to modify Unix. The GNU Project, started in
				1983 by Richard Stallman, had the goal of creating a "complete Unix-compatible software system"
				composed entirely of free software. Work began in 1984.[34] Later, in 1985, Stallman started the Free
				Software Foundation and wrote the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) in 1989. By the early 1990s,
				many of the programs required in an operating system (such as libraries, compilers, text editors, a
				Unix shell, and a windowing system) were completed, although low-level elements such as device drivers,
				daemons, and the kernel, called GNU/Hurd, were stalled and incomplete.</p>

			<p>Refusing to give up, he sees an old car, which he realizes certainly cannot be his mother. In
				desperation,
				the hatchling calls out to a boat and a plane (neither responds), and at last, climbs onto the teeth of
				an
				enormous power shovel. It belches "SNORT" from its exhaust stack, prompting the bird to cry, "You are
				not my mother! You are a Snort!" As the machine shudders and grinds into motion, he cannot escape.
				"I want my mother!" he shouts.</p>

			<b>Creation</b>
			<p>In 1991, while attending the University of Helsinki, Torvalds became curious about operating
				systems. Frustrated by the licensing of MINIX, which at the time limited it to educational use only,
				he began to work on his own operating system kernel, which eventually became the Linux kernel.</p>

			<b>Naming</b>
			<p>Linus Torvalds had wanted to call his invention "Freax", a portmanteau of "free", "freak", and "x"
				(as an allusion to Unix). During the start of his work on the system, some of the project's makefiles
				included the name "Freax" for about half a year. Torvalds had already considered the name "Linux",
				but initially dismissed it as too egotistical.</p>

			<b>Current development</b>
			<p>Torvalds continues to direct the development of the kernel. Stallman heads the Free Software
				Foundation, which in turn supports the GNU components. Finally, individuals and corporations
				develop third-party non-GNU components. These third-party components comprise a vast body of work
				and may include both kernel modules and user applications and libraries.</p>

			<br>
			<font size="3">
				<h1><i>Design</i></h2>
			</font>
			<hr color=black>
			<p>A Linux-based system is a modular Unix-like operating system, deriving much of its basic design
				from principles established in Unix during the 1970s and 1980s. Such a system uses a monolithic
				kernel, the Linux kernel, which handles process control, networking, access to the peripherals, and
				file
				systems. Device drivers are either integrated directly with the kernel, or added as modules that are
				loaded while the system is running.</p>

				<h1><i>Critical reaction</i></h2>
			</font>
			<hr color=black>
			<p>The book's subjective appeal is derived from a compelling and compact plot full of humorous
				adventure, aided by line drawings that appeal to young children.</p>

			<b>User interface</b>
			<p>The user interface, also known as the shell, is either a command-line interface (CLI), a graphical user
				interface (GUI), or through controls attached to the associated hardware, which is common for
				embedded systems. For desktop systems, the default mode is usually a graphical user interface,
				although the CLI is commonly available through terminal emulator windows or on a separate virtual
				console.</p>

			<p>CLI shells are text-based user interfaces, which use text for both input and output. The dominant
				shell used in Linux is the Bourne-Again Shell (bash), originally developed for the GNU project. Most
				low-
				level Linux components, including various parts of the userland, use the CLI exclusively. The CLI is
				particularly suited for automation of repetitive or delayed tasks, and provides very simple
				inter-process
				communication.</p>

			<br>
			<font size="3">
				<h1><i>Development</i></h2>
			</font>
			<hr color=black>
			<p>The primary difference between Linux and many other popular contemporary operating systems
				is that the Linux kernel and other components are free and open-source software. Linux is not the only
				such operating system, although it is by far the most widely used.[66] Some free and open-source
				software licenses are based on the principle of copyleft, a kind of reciprocity: any work derived from
				a
				copyleft piece of software must also be copyleft itself. The most common free software license, the GNU
				General Public License (GPL), is a form of copyleft, and is used for the Linux kernel and many of the
				components from the GNU Project.</p>

			<b>Community</b>
			<p>A distribution is largely driven by its developer and user communities. Some vendors develop and
				fund their distributions on a volunteer basis, Debian being a well-known example. Others maintain a
				community version of their commercial distributions, as Red Hat does with Fedora, and SUSE does with
				openSUSE.</p>

			<b>Programming on Linux</b>
			<p>Linux distributions support dozens of programming languages. The original development tools
				used for building both Linux applications and operating system programs are found within the GNU
				toolchain, which includes the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) and the GNU Build System. Amongst
				others, GCC provides compilers for Ada, C, C++, Go and Fortran. Many programming languages have
				a cross-platform reference implementation that supports Linux, for example PHP, Perl, Ruby, Python,
				Java, Go, Rust and Haskell. First released in 2003, the LLVM project provides an alternative
				cross-platform
				open-source compiler for many languages. Proprietary compilers for Linux include the Intel C++
				Compiler, Sun Studio, and IBM XL C/C++ Compiler. BASIC in the form of Visual Basic is supported in
				such forms as Gambas, FreeBASIC, and XBasic, and in terms of terminal programming or QuickBASIC
				or Turbo BASIC programming in the form of QB64.</p>

				<h1><i>Hardware support</i></h2>
			</font>
			<hr color=black>
			<p>The Linux kernel is a widely ported operating system kernel, available for devices ranging from
				mobile phones to supercomputers; it runs on a highly diverse range of computer architectures, including
				the hand-held ARM-based iPAQ and the IBM mainframes System z9 or System z10. Specialized
				distributions and kernel forks exist for less mainstream architectures; for example, the ELKS kernel
				fork can run on Intel 8086 or Intel 80286 16-bit microprocessors, while the �Clinux kernel fork may
				run on systems without a memory management unit. The kernel also runs on architectures that were
				only ever intended to use a manufacturer-created operating system, such as Macintosh computers
				(with both PowerPC and Intel processors), PDAs, video game consoles, portable music players, and
				mobile phones.</p>
