			<h1><i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i></h2>
		</font>
		<hr color=black>
		<font size="5"><b>Slaughterhouse-Five</b>
			<p><b>Slaughterhouse-Five, or The Children's Crusade: A Duty-Dance with Death</b> (1969) is a
				science fiction-infused anti-war novel by Kurt Vonnegut about the World War II experiences and
				journeys through time of Billy Pilgrim, from his time as an American soldier and chaplain's assistant,
				to postwar and early years. It is generally recognized as Vonnegut's most influential and popular work.
				A central event is Pilgrim's surviving the Allies' firebombing of Dresden as a prisoner-of-war. This
				was
				an event in Vonnegut's own life, and the novel is considered semi-autobiographical.</p>

			<br>
			<font size="3">
				<h1><i>Plot summary</i></h2>
			</font>
			<hr color=black>
			<p>The story is told in a nonlinear order, and events become clear through flashbacks (or time travel
				experiences) from the unreliable narrator. He describes the stories of Billy Pilgrim, who believes he
				was
				held in an alien zoo and has experienced time travel.</p>

			<p>Billy Pilgrim, a chaplain's assistant in the United States Army during World War II, is an ill-trained,
				disoriented, and fatalistic American soldier who refuses to fight ("Billy wouldn't do anything to save
				himself"). He does not like war and is captured in 1944 by the Germans during the Battle of the Bulge.
				Billy approaches death due to a string of events. Before the Germans capture Billy, he meets Roland
				Weary, a patriot, warmonger, and bully (just out of childhood like Billy), who derides the soldier's
				cowardice. When Weary is captured, the Germans confiscate everything he has, including his boots,
				giving him hinged, wooden clogs to wear; Weary eventually dies in Luxembourg of gangrene caused
				by wounds from the stiff clogs. While dying in a railcar full of prisoners, Weary convinces fellow
				soldier,
				Paul Lazzaro, that Billy is to blame for his death. Lazzaro vows to avenge Weary's death by killing
				Billy,
				because revenge is "the sweetest thing in life."</p>

			<p>At this moment, Billy becomes "unstuck in time" and has flashbacks from his former life. Billy and
				the other prisoners are transported by the Germans to Luxembourg. By 1945, the Germans transport
				the prisoners to Dresden to work in "contract labor" (forced labor). The Germans hold Billy and his
				fellow prisoners in an empty Dresden slaughterhouse, "Schlachthof-f�nf," "slaughterhouse five."
				During the extensive bombing by the Allies, German guards hide with the prisoners of war in a deep
				cellar. This results in their being among the few survivors of the firestorm that raged in the city
				between 13 and 15 February 1945. After V-E Day in May 1945, Billy is transferred to the United States
				and receives his honorable discharge in July 1945.</p>

			<br>
			<font size="3">
				<h1><i>Characters</i></h2>
			</font>
			<hr color=black>
			<font size="5" color="#0645ad">Narrator</font>
			<p>Intrusive and recurring as a minor character, the narrator seems anonymous while also clearly
				identifying himself when he, the narrator, says: "That was I. That was me. That was the author of this
				book."As noted above, as a soldier, Vonnegut was captured by Germans at the Battle of the Bulge and
				transported to Dresden. He and fellow prisoners survived the bombing while being held in a deep
				cellar of Schlachthof F�nf (Slaughterhouse 5). The narrator begins the story describing his
				connection to the fire-bombing of Dresden and his reasons for writing Slaughterhouse-Five.</p>

			<font size="5" color="#0645ad">Billy Pilgrim</font>
			<p>A fatalistic optometrist ensconced in a dull, safe marriage in Ilium, New York. During World War II,
				he was held as a prisoner of war in Dresden, surviving the firebombing, experiences which had a
				lasting effect on his post-war life. His time travel occurs at desperate times in his life; he re-lives
				events
				past and future and becomes fatalistic (though not a defeatist) because he has seen when, how and
				why he will die.</p>

			<br>
			<font size="3">
				<h1><i>Allusions and references</i></h2>
			</font>
			<hr color=black>
			<br>
			<b>Allusions to other works</b>
			<p>As in other novels by Vonnegut, certain characters cross over from other stories, making cameo
				appearances and connecting the discrete novels to a greater opus. Fictional novelist Kilgore Trout,
				often an important character in other Vonnegut novels, in Slaughterhouse-Five is a social commentator
				and a friend to Billy Pilgrim. In one case, he is the only non-optometrist at a party, therefore, he is
				the
				odd-man-out. He ridicules everything the Ideal American Family holds true, such as Heaven, Hell, and
				Sin. In Trout's opinion, people do not know if the things they do turn out to be good or bad, and if
				they
				turn out to be bad, they go to Hell, where "the burning never stops hurting." Other crossover
				characters are Eliot Rosewater, from God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater; Howard W. Campbell, Jr., from
				Mother Night; and Bertram Copeland Rumfoord, relative of Winston Niles Rumfoord, from The Sirens
				of Titan. While Vonnegut re-uses characters, the characters are frequently rebooted and do not
				necessarily maintain the same biographical details from appearance to appearance. Kilgore Trout in
				particular is palpably a different person (although with distinct, consistent character traits) in each
				of
				his appearances in Vonnegut's work.</p>

			<p>Mr. Rosewater says that Fyodor Dostoyevsky's novel The Brothers Karamazov contains "everything
				there was to know about life." Vonnegut refers to The Marriage of Heaven and Hell when talking about
				William Blake, Billy's hospital mate's favorite poet.</p>

			<p>In the Twayne's United States Authors series volume on Kurt Vonnegut, about the protagonist's
				name, Stanley Schatt says:</p>

				<h1><i>Reception</i></h2>
			</font>
			<hr color=black>
			<p>The reviews of Slaughterhouse-Five have been largely positive since the March 31, 1969 review in
				The New York Times newspaper that stated: "you'll either love it, or push it back in the
				science-fiction
				corner." It was Vonnegut's first novel to become a bestseller, staying on the New York Times
				bestsellers
				list for sixteen weeks (peaking at #4).[33] In 1970, Slaughterhouse-Five was nominated for a best-novel
				Nebula Award and for a best-novel Hugo Award. It lost both to The Left Hand of Darkness, by Ursula K.
				Le Guin. In 1998, the Modern Library ranked Slaughterhouse-Five eighteenth on its list of the 100 best
				English-language novels of the 20th century. It also appeared in Time magazine's list of the 100 best
				English-language novels written since 1923.</p>

				<h1><i>Adaptations</i></h2>
			</font>
			<hr color=black>
			<p>A film adaptation of the book, also called Slaughterhouse-Five, was released in 1972. Although
				critically praised, the film was a box office flop. It won the Prix du Jury at the 1972 Cannes Film
				Festival, as well as a Hugo Award and Saturn Award. Vonnegut commended the film greatly. In 2013,
				Guillermo del Toro announced his intention to remake the 1972 film and work with a script by Charlie
				Kaufman,[42] originally hoping to release it in early 2011. Due to his involvement with The Hobbit, the
				project was pushed back and remains uncertain.</p>

			<p>In 1989, a theatrical adaption premiered at the Everyman Theatre, in Liverpool, UK. This was the
				first time the novel had been presented on stage. It was adapted for the theater by Vince Foxall and
				directed by Paddy Cunneen.</p>

			<p>In 1996, another theatrical adaptation of the novel premiered at the Steppenwolf Theatre Company
				in Chicago, IL. The adaptation was written and directed by Eric Simonson and featured actors Rick
				Snyder, Robert Breuler and Deanna Dunagan.[43] The play has subsequently been performed in
				several other theaters, including a January 2008 New York premiere production by the Godlight
				Theatre Company. An operatic adaptation by Hans-J�rgen von Bose premiered in July 1996 at the
				Bavarian State Opera in Munich, Germany. Billy Pilgrim II was sung by Uwe Schonbeck.</p>

			<p>In September 2009, BBC Radio 3 broadcast a feature length radio drama based on the book, which
				was dramatised by Dave Sheasby, featured Andrew Scott as Billy Pilgrim and was scored by the group
				65daysofstatic.</p>

			<p>From June 9 to July 3, 2015, Book-It Repertory Theatre in Seattle, Washington, USA, presented an
				adaptation of the book by Josh Aaseng, who also directed. Actors Robert Bergin, Erik Grafton, and Todd
				Jefferson Moore were Billy Pilgrim at three different ages. As is Book-It's practice, every word in the
				production was taken directly from the text of the book.</p>
