			<h1><i>Down Under</i></h2>
		</font>
		<hr color=black>
		<font size="5"><b>Down Under</b> Down Under is the British title of a 2000 travelogue book about
			Australia written by best-selling travel writer Bill Bryson. In the United States and Canada it was
			published titled<b> In a Sunburned Country </b>, a title taken from the famous Australian poem,
			"My Country". It was also published as part of Walk About, which included Down Under and another
			of Bryson's books, A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail, in one
			volume.

			<br>
			<br>
			<font size="3">
				<h1><i>Summary</i></h2>
			</font>
			<hr color=black>
			<p>Bill Bryson describes his travels by railway and car throughout Australia, his conversations with
				people in all walks of life about the history, geography, unusual plants and animals of the country,
				and
				his wry impressions of the life, culture and amenities (or lack thereof) in each locality.</p>

			<p>In a style similar to his book A Walk in the Woods, or William Least Heat-Moon's Blue Highways,
				Bryson's research enabled him to include many stories about Australia's 19th-century explorers and
				settlers who suffered extreme deprivations, as well as details about its natural resources, culture,
				and
				economy. His writings are intertwined with recurring humorous themes, notably, in the chapter
				Crossing Australia he makes constant reference to drinking of urine to survive, as was done by many
				19th century explorers. He jokingly adds, about a certain explorer "...I daresay he drank some of his
				own urine" and "They drank their own and their horse's urine"</p>


			<br>
			<font size="3">
				<h1><i>Synopsis</i></h2>
			</font>
			<hr color=black>
			The book consists of three parts.
			<ol>
				<li>Into the Outback
					<p>The first part of the book mainly describes the journey taken by Bryson aboard the Indian
						Pacific
						railway from Sydney to Perth. He is accompanied on this journey by a young English photographer
						named Trevor Ray Hart. The author describes his experiences on the train, the places the train
						passes
						through on its way to Perth such as the Blue Mountains and White Cliffs. The author also
						supplies
						plenty of humor in the form of historical accounts of early explorers and settlers of
						Australia.</p>

						<br>

				<li>Civilized Australia (The Boomerang Coast)
					<p>This section of the book starts off with historical accounts from the time when Australia was
						discovered and goes on to illustrate how the Australians built a dynamic and prosperous society
						from
						a modest and unpropitious beginning. The rest of this section is devoted to the author's
						account of
						what he considers to be Civilized Australia.</p>

				<li> Around the edges
					<p>This part of the journey covers the Great Barrier Reef, Alice Springs and the mighty monolithic
						rock Uluru.</p>
