			<h1><i>The Catcher in the Rye</i></h2>
		</font>
		<hr color=black>
		<font size="5"><b>The Catcher in the Rye</b> is a 1951 novel by J. D. Salinger. A classic novel origin
			ally published for adults, it has since become popular with adolescent readers for its themes of teenage
			angst and alienation. It has been translated into almost all of the world's major languages. Around 1
			million copies are sold each year with total sales of more than 65 million books.The novel's protagonist
			Holden Caulfield has become an icon for teenage rebellion.The novel also deals with complex issues of
			innocence, identity, belonging, loss, and connection.

			<p>The novel was included on Time's 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels written since
				1923 and it was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language
				novels of the 20th century. In 2003, it was listed at #15 on the BBC's survey The Big Read.</p>

			<br>
			<font size="3">
				<h1><i>Plot</i></h2>
			</font>
			<hr color=black>
			<p>Holden Caulfield, a teenager from New York City, is living in an unspecified institution in southern
				California near Hollywood in 1951. Caulfield intends to live with his brother D.B, an author and World
				War II veteran whom Holden resents for becoming a screenwriter, after his release in one month. As
				he waits, Holden recalls the events of the previous Christmas.</p>

			Holden begins his story at Pencey Preparatory Academy, an exclusive boarding school in Agerstown,
			Pennsylvania, on the Saturday afternoon of the traditional football game with a rival school. Holden
			has been expelled from Pencey due to poor work and is not to return after Christmas break, which
			begins the following Wednesday. He plans to return home on that day so that he will not be present
			when his parents receive notice of his expulsion. After forfeiting a fencing match in New York by forget
			ting the equipment aboard the subway, he is invited to the home of his history teacher, Mr. Spencer.
			Spencer is a well-meaning but long-winded old man. Spencer greets him and offers him advice, but
			embarrasses Holden by further criticizing Holden's work in his subject in a rude manner.

				<h1><i>History</i></h2>
			</font>
			<hr color=black>
			<p>Various older stories by Salinger contain characters similar to those in The Catcher in the Rye.
				While at Columbia University, Salinger wrote a short story called "The Young Folks" in Whit Burnett's
				class; one character from this story has been described as a "thinly penciled prototype of Sally
				Hayes".
				In November 1941, he sold the story "Slight Rebellion off Madison", which featured Holden Caulfield,
				to The New Yorker, but it wasn't published until December 21, 1946 due to World War II. The story
				"I'm Crazy", which was published in the December 22, 1945, issue of Collier's, contained material that
				was later used in The Catcher in the Rye. In 1946, The New Yorker accepted a 90-page manuscript
				about Holden Caulfield for publication, but Salinger later withdrew it.</p>

			<br>
			<font size="3">
				<h1><i>Writing style</i></h2>
			</font>
			<hr color=black>
			<p>The Catcher in the Rye is narrated in a subjective style from the point of view of Holden Caulfield,
				following his exact thought processes. There is flow in the seemingly disjointed ideas and episodes;
				for
				example, as Holden sits in a chair in his dorm, minor events, such as picking up a book or looking at a
				table, unfold into discussions about experiences.</p>

			<p>Critical reviews affirm that the novel accurately reflected the teenage colloquial speech of the time.
				Words and phrases that appear frequently include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>"Old" � term of familiarity or endearment.
				<li>"Phony" � superficially acting a certain way only to change what others think of you
				<li>"That killed me" � I found that hilarious or astonishing
				<li>"Flit" � homosexual
				<li>"Crumbum" or "crumby" � inadequate, insufficient, disappointing
				<li>"Snowing" � sweet-talking
				<li>"I got a bang out of that" � I found it hilarious or exciting
				<li>"Shoot the bull" � have a conversation containing false elements
				<li>"Give her the time" or "necking" � sexual intercourse
				<li>"Chew the fat" or "chew the rag" � small-talk
				<li>"Rubbering" or "rubbernecks" � idle onlooking/onlookers
				<li>"The Can" � the bathroom
			</ul>

				<h1><i>Reception</i></h2>
			</font>
			<hr color=black>
			<p>The Catcher in the Rye has been listed as one of the best novels of the twentieth century. Shortly
				after its publication, writing for The New York Times, Nash K. Burger called it "an unusually brilliant
				novel," while James Stern wrote an admiring review of the book in a voice imitating Holden's.
				George H. W. Bush called it a "marvelous book," listing it among the books that have inspired him. In
				June 2009, the BBC's Finlo Rohrer wrote that, 58 years since publication, the book is still regarded
				"as
				the defining work on what it is like to be a teenager. Holden is at various times disaffected,
				disgruntled,
				alienated, isolated, directionless, and sarcastic." Adam Gopnik considers it one of the "three perfect
				books" in American literature, along with Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and The Great Gatsby, and
				believes that "no book has ever captured a city better than Catcher in the Rye captured New York in
				the fifties." Jeff Pruchnic wrote an appraisal of The Catcher in the Rye after the death of J.D.
				Salinger. In this article, Pruchnic focuses on how the novel continues to be received incredibly well,
				even after it has aged many generations. Pruchnic describes Holden as a �teenage protagonist frozen
				midcentury but destined to be discovered by those of a similar age in every generation to come�. Bill
				Gates said that The Catcher in the Rye is one of his favorite books ever.</p>
