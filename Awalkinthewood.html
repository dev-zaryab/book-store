			<h1><i>A Walk in the Woods</i></h2>
		</font>
		<hr color=black>
		<font size="5"><b>A Walk in the Woods</b> is a 2015 American biographical comedy-drama film
			directed by Ken Kwapis, based on the 1998 book/memoir of the same name by Bill Bryson. The film
			stars Robert Redford, Nick Nolte and Emma Thompson. The film was released on September 2, 2015,
			by Broad Green Pictures.

			<br>
			<br>
			<font size="3">
				<h1><i>Plot</i></h2>
			</font>
			<hr color=black>
			<p>Author Bill Bryson (Robert Redford), after living for ten years in Great Britain, returned to New
				Hampshire. Now in his 60s, he has been living there peacefully for the past twenty years. A television
				interview reports that he has published several popular books and there is speculation he will be
				writing more. Bryson, however, has no such plans.</p>

			<p>Bryson and his wife Catherine (Emma Thompson) attend a funeral. Not being an outgoing person,
				he afterwards takes a stroll up to the nearby Appalachian Trail. He suddenly decides he will hike its
				entire length. Catherine objects, presenting all kinds of accounts about accidents and murders on the
				trail. She relents on condition that he not travel alone. He agrees and searches for a friend willing
				to
				join him. Everyone declines his invitation; some declare him insane. Finally, he is contacted by
				Stephen
				Katz (Nick Nolte), an old friend who offers to be a hiking companion. Despite appearances, Stephen
				claims to be fit enough for the challenge. Bill's wife is unhappy with his choice, but relents.</p>

			<p>Within less than a mile of their departure point, as groups of hikers overtake and pass them, they
				begin to grasp the difficulty of their ambition. Shortly after, a group of young children effortlessly
				runs
				by them up the trail, laughing and calling out to each other. Seeing others pass by so easily motivates
				them to carry on. And so they move on, day by day, making more or less pleasant acquaintances,
				having more or less pleasant experiences. Some time later they reach a hut, having hiked miserably
				through pouring rain. Carved into the log wall is an Appalachian Trail map showing the trail and their
				present location. They realize they have finished less than half of the trail after spending three
				months
				on it. Eventually they trek into a restricted section posted "for experienced hikers only". While
				maneuvering their heavy and awkward backpacks alongside a precipitous drop, Bill trips and pulls
				Stephen with him down a steep, rocky cliff. They fall about fifteen feet onto a ledge spacious enough
				to
				be comfortable, but far enough below the trail to be unable to get back up to resume the hike. They
				spend the night there with no clear hope of rescue. Luckily, the next day they are awakened by early
				morning hikers who are able to get them off the ledge.</p>

			<p>Eventually, they decide they have had enough and end their journey. When comfortably back at
				home, Bill, going through his mail, finds a series of post cards from Stephen that were mailed from
				their various stops along the trail. The last one reads: "What's next?' Bill sits down and begins
				typing
				on his computer, "A WALK IN THE WOODS."</p>

				<h1><i>Production</i></h2>
			</font>
			<hr color=black>
			<p>The project dates back to at least 2005, at which Robert Redford first announced his plans to make
				the film. At various points directors such as Chris Columbus, Barry Levinson and Larry Charles were
				attached. However, Ken Kwapis ended up directing the picture.</p>

			<p>Redford initially wanted Paul Newman to costar in the film with him, to the point where Redford
				temporarily abandoned the project after Newman's death unable to picture any other actor suitable
				for the role. However, while directing The Company You Keep, Redford was so impressed by the
				performance of Nick Nolte that he was eventually cast in the role.</p>


			<br>
			<font size="3">
				<h1><i>Release</i></h2>
			</font>
			<hr color=black>
			<p>The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 23, 2015. Shortly after, Broad Green
				Pictures acquired distribution rights to the film, and gave it a wide theatrical release starting
				September 2, 2015.</p>

				<h1><i>Reception</i></h2>

			A Walk in the Woods has received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a
			rating of 46%, based on 146 reviews, with an average rating of 5.4/10. The site's critical consensus
			reads, "Amiable yet less compelling than any road trip movie starring Robert Redford and Nick Nolte
			should be, A Walk in the Woods is ultimately a bit too pedestrian."[18] On Metacritic, the film has a
			score of 51 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". On CinemaScore,
			audiences gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale.
