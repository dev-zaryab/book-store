			<h1><i>Fahrenheit 451</i></h2>
		</font>
		<hr color=black>
		<font size="5"><b>Fahrenheit 451</b> is a dystopian novel by American writer Ray Bradbury, published in
			1953. It is regarded as one of his best works.[3] The novel presents a future American society where
			books are outlawed and "firemen" burn any that are found.[4] The book's tagline explains the title:
			"Fahrenheit 451 � the temperature at which book paper catches fire, and burns..." The lead character
			is a fireman named Montag who becomes disillusioned with the role of censoring works and destroying
			knowledge, eventually quitting his job and joining a resistance group who memorize and share the
			world's greatest literary and cultural works.

			<p>The novel has been the subject of interpretations focusing on the historical role of book burning in
				suppressing dissenting ideas. In a 1956 radio interview, Bradbury stated that he wrote Fahrenheit 451
				because of his concerns at the time (during the McCarthy era) about the threat of book burning in the
				United States. In later years, he described the book as a commentary on how mass media reduces
				interest in reading literature.</p>

			<p>In 1954, Fahrenheit 451 won the American Academy of Arts and Letters Award in Literature and
				the Commonwealth Club of California Gold Medal. It has since won the Prometheus "Hall of
				Fame" Award in 1984 and a 1954 "Retro" Hugo Award, one of only five Best Novel Retro Hugos
				ever given, in 2004. Bradbury was honored with a Spoken Word Grammy nomination for his 1976
				audiobook version</p>

			<p>Adaptations include Fran�ois Truffaut's 1966 film adaptation of the novel and a 1982 BBC Radio
				dramatization. Bradbury published a stage play version in 1979 and helped develop a 1984
				interactive fiction computer game titled Fahrenheit 451, and a collection of his short stories, A
				Pleasure to Burn.</p>

			<br>
			<font size="3">
				<h1><i>Plot Summary</i></h2>
			</font>
			<hr color=black>
			<p><i>Fahrenheit 451</i> is set in an unspecified city (likely in the American Midwest) at an unspecified
				time
				in the future after the year 1960.</p>

			The novel is divided into three parts: "The Hearth and the Salamander", "The Sieve and the Sand", and
			"Burning Bright".
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>"The Hearth and the Salamander"</b>
			<p>Guy Montag is a "fireman" employed to burn the possessions of those who read outlawed books.
				He is married and has no children. One fall night while returning from work, he meets his new
				neighbor, a teenage girl named Clarisse McClellan, whose free-thinking ideals and liberating spirit
				cause him to question his life and his own perceived happiness. Montag returns home to find that his
				wife Mildred has overdosed on sleeping pills, and he calls for medical attention. Two uncaring EMTs
				come over to pump Mildred's stomach, drain her poisoned blood, and fill her with new blood. After the
				EMTs leave to rescue another overdose victim, Montag watches over Mildred, watching the new blood
				fill her pallid cheeks. Montag then goes outside, overhearing Clarisse and her family talk about the
				way life is in this hedonistic, illiterate society. Montag's mind is bombarded with Clarisse's
				subversive
				thoughts and the memory of his wife's near-death. The next day, Montag finds Mildred in the kitchen,
				with no memory of what happened and talking incessantly about being hungry from an alleged
				hangover she has from a party she thought she attended last night. Over the next few days, Clarisse
				faithfully meets Montag as he walks home. She tells him about how her simple pleasures and interests
				make her an outcast among her peers and how she's forced to go to therapy for her behavior and
				thoughts. Montag looks forward to these meetings, and just as he begins to expect them, Clarisse goes
				absent. He senses something is wrong.</p>

			<p>In the following days, while at work with the other firemen ransacking the book-filled house of an
				old woman before the inevitable burning, Montag steals a book before any of his coworkers notice.
				The woman refuses to leave her house and her books, choosing instead to light a match and burn
				herself alive. Montag returns home jarred by the woman's suicide. While getting ready for bed, he
				hides the stolen book under his pillow. Still shaken by the night's events, he attempts to make
				conversation with Mildred, starting by asking her when they first met and where. Mildred goes to
				answer, but immediately forgets. As she laughs off her ignorance and heads for the bathroom to take
				more sleeping pills, Montag realizes just how much Mildred's sleeping pill addiction, love of vapid,
				interactive entertainment, and fast, reckless driving has ruined her mind and their marriage. Later,
				as Mildred is sleeping, Montag wakes her up and asks her if she has seen or heard anything about
				Clarisse McClellan. Mildred initially brushes off the question until she finally reveals what happened:
				Clarisse's family moved away after Clarisse got hit by a speeding car and died four days ago.
				Dismayed by her failure to mention this earlier, Montag uneasily tries to fall asleep. Outside he
				suspects the presence of "The Hound", an eight-legged[17] robotic dog-like creature that resides in the
				firehouse and aids the firemen.</p>

			<p>Montag awakens ill the next morning, with Mildred nagging him to get up and go to work. As
				Mildred tries to care for her husband (but finds herself more involved in the parlor wall entertainment
				in the next room), Montag suggests that maybe he should take a break from being a fireman after
				what happened last night. Mildred panics over the thought of losing the house and her parlor wall
				family and angrily blames the old woman who killed herself over her books for Montag's change of
				heart over his job. Captain Beatty, Montag's fire chief, personally visits Montag to see how he is
				doing.
				Sensing Montag's concerns, Beatty recounts how books lost their value and where the firemen fit in:
				over the course of several decades, people embraced new media (in this case, film and television),
				sports, and a quickening pace of life. Books were ruthlessly abridged or degraded to accommodate a
				short attention span while minority groups protested over the controversial, outdated content
				perceived to be found in literature (yet comic books, trade papers, and sex magazines were allowed to
				stay, as those fed into the population's want for mindless entertainment). The government took
				advantage of this by turning the firemen into officers of people's peace of mind. After an awkward
				encounter between Millie and Montag over the book hidden under Montag's pillow, Beatty is suspicious
				that Montag may have a book. Beatty casually adds a passing threat as he leaves, telling Montag that
				if a fireman had a book, he would be asked to burn it within the next 24 hours. If not, the other
				firemen would come and burn his house down for him. Despite the subtlety of the statement, the
				encounter leaves Montag shaken. He then decides to take action once and for all.</p>

			<p>After Beatty has left, Montag reveals to Mildred that, over the last year, he has accumulated a stash
				of books that he has kept hidden in their air-conditioning duct. In a panic, Mildred grabs a book and
				rushes to throw it in their kitchen incinerator. Montag subdues her and tells her that the two of them
				are going to read the books to see if they have value. If they do not, he promises the books will be
				burned, and all will return to normal.</p>

			<b>"The Sieve and the Sand"</b>
			<p>While Montag and Mildred are perusing the stolen books, a sniffing occurs at their front door.
				Montag recognizes it as The Hound while Mildred passes it off as a random dog. They resume their
				discussion once the sound ceases, but Mildred refuses to go along with it, questioning why she or
				anyone else should care about books. Montag goes on a rant about Mildred's suicide attempt, Clarisse's
				disappearance and death, the old woman who burned herself, and the constant din of bombers flying
				overhead and the imminent threat of war that goes ignored by the masses. He then states that maybe
				the books of the past have messages that can save society from its own destruction. The conversation
				is interrupted by a call from Mildred's friend, Mrs. Bowles, and they set up a date to watch the
				"parlor
				walls" (large televisions lining the walls of her living room) that night at Mildred's house.</p>

			<p>Montag, meanwhile, concedes that Mildred is a lost cause and he will need help to understand the
				books. Montag remembers an old man named Faber he once met in a park a year ago, an English
				professor before books were banned. He telephones Faber with questions about books, and Faber soon
				hangs up on him. Undeterred, Montag makes a subway trip to Faber's home along with a rare copy of
				the Bible, the book he stole at the woman's house. He tries to read it on the way, but gets distracted
				by
				a radio jingle for Denham's Dentifrice and nearly goes insane. Once he arrives at Faber's house,
				Montag forces the scared and reluctant Faber into helping him by methodically ripping pages from
				the Bible. Faber concedes and gives Montag a homemade ear-piece communicator so he can offer
				constant guidance.</p>

			<b>"Burning Bright"</b>
			<p>Beatty orders Montag to destroy his own house, telling him that his wife and her friends reported
				him after what happened the other night. Montag watches as Mildred walks out of the house, too
				traumatized about losing her parlor wall family to even acknowledge her husband's existence or the
				situation going on around her, and catches a taxi, never once looking back. Montag obeys the chief,
				destroying the home piece by piece with a flamethrower. As soon as he has incinerated the house,
				Beatty discovers Montag's ear-piece and plans to hunt down Faber. Montag threatens Beatty with the
				flamethrower and (after Beatty taunts him) burns his boss alive, and knocks his coworkers unconscious.
				As Montag escapes the scene, the firehouse's mechanical dog attacks him, managing to inject his leg
				with a tranquilizer. He destroys The Hound with the flamethrower and limps away.
			<p>

			<p>Montag runs through the city streets towards Faber's house. Faber urges him to make his way to
				the countryside and contact the exiled book-lovers who live there. He mentions he will be
				leaving on an
				early bus heading to St. Louis and that he and Montag can rendezvous there later. On Faber's
				television
				they watch news reports of another mechanical hound being released, with news helicopters
				following
				it to create a public spectacle. After successfully wiping Montag's scent from around the house
				in hopes
				of deterring the hound, Montag leaves Faber's house. After an extended manhunt, he escapes by
				wading into a river and floating downstream.</p>

				<h1><i>Characters</i></h2>
			</font>
			<hr color=black>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Guy Montag</b> is the protagonist and fireman who presents the dystopia through the eyes
					of a worker
					loyal to it, a man in conflict about it, and someone resolved to be free of it. Through
					most of the book,
					Montag lacks knowledge and believes what he hears.
				<li><b>Clarisse McClellan</b> walks with Montag on his trips home and is one month short of her
					17th birthday.
					She is an unusual sort of person in the bookless, hedonistic society: outgoing, naturally
					cheerful,
					unorthodox, and intuitive. She is unpopular among peers and disliked by teachers for asking
					"why"
					instead of "how" and focusing on nature rather than on technology. A few days after their
					first meeting
					she disappears without any explanation; Mildred tells Montag (and Captain Beatty confirms)
					that
					Clarisse was hit by a speeding car and that her family left following her death. In the
					afterword of a
					later edition, Bradbury notes that the film adaptation changed the ending so that Clarisse
					(who, in the
					film, is now a 20-year-old school teacher who was fired for being unorthodox) was living
					with the exiles.
					Bradbury, far from being displeased by this, was so happy with the new ending that he wrote
					it into
					his later stage edition.
				<li><b>Mildred "Millie" Montag</b> is Guy Montag's wife. She is addicted to sleeping pills,
					absorbed in the
					shallow dramas played on her "parlor walls" (flat-panel televisions), and indifferent to
					the oppressive
					society around her. She is described in the book as "thin as a praying mantis from dieting,
					her hair
					burnt by chemicals to a brittle straw, and her flesh like white bacon." Despite her
					husband's attempts
					to break her from the spell society has on her, Mildred continues to be shallow and
					indifferent. After
					Montag scares her friends away by reading Dover Beach and unable to live with someone who
					has
					been hoarding books, Mildred betrays Montag by reporting him to the firemen and abandoning
					him.
				<li><b>Captain Beatty</b> is Montag's boss. Once an avid reader, he has come to hate books due
					to their
					unpleasant content, and contradicting facts and opinions. In a scene written years later by
					Bradbury
					for the Fahrenheit 451 play, Beatty invites Montag to his house where he shows him walls of
					books left
					to molder on their shelves.
				<li><b>Stoneman</b> and <b>Black</b> are Montag's coworkers at the firehouse. They do not have
					a large impact on
					the story and function to show the reader the contrast between the firemen who obediently
					do as
					they're told and someone like Montag, who formerly took pride in his job but subsequently
					realizes
					how damaging it is to society.
				<li><b>Faber</b> is a former English professor. He has spent years regretting that he did not
					defend books
					when he saw the moves to ban them. Montag turns to him for guidance, remembering him from a
					chance meeting in a park sometime earlier. Faber at first refuses to help Montag, and later
					realizes
					Montag is only trying to learn about books, not destroy them. Bradbury notes in his
					afterword that
					Faber is part of the name of a German manufacturer of pencils, Faber-Castell.
				<li><b>Mrs. Ann Bowles</b> and <b>Mrs. Clara Phelps</b> are Mildred's friends and
					representative of the anti-intellectual,
					hedonistic society presented in the novel. During a social visit to Montag's house, they
					brag about
					ignoring the bad things in their lives and have a cavalier attitude towards the upcoming
					war, their
					husbands, their children, and politics. Mrs. Phelps' husband Pete was called in to fight in
					the upcoming
					war (and believes that he'll be back in a week because of how quick the war will be) and
					thinks having
					children serves no purpose other than to ruin lives. Mrs. Bowles is a thrice married,
					single mother.
					Her first husband divorced her, her second died in a jet accident, and her third committed
					suicide by
					shooting himself in the head. She has two children who do not like or respect her due to
					her permissive,
					often negligent and abusive parenting; Mrs. Bowles brags that her kids beat her up, and
					she's glad she
					can hit back. When Montag reads Dover Beach to them, he strikes a chord in Mrs. Phelps, who
					starts
					crying over how hollow her life is. Mrs. Bowles chastises Montag for reading "silly awful
					hurting words".
				<li><b>Granger</b> is the leader of a group of wandering intellectual exiles who memorize books
					in order to
					preserve their contents.

				<h1><i>Title</i></h2>
			</font>
			<hr color=black>
			<p>The title refers to the temperature 451 �F (233 �C) that Bradbury thought was the autoignition
				temperature of paper.[19][20] Though this is popularly believed to be correct, scientists place
				the
				autoignition temperature at 424�475 �F (218�246 �C) depending on the study and type of paper.
			</p>

			<br>
			<font size="3">
				<h1><i>Publication history</i></h2>
			</font>
			<hr color=black>
			<p>The first U.S. printing was a paperback version from October 1953 by The Ballantine Publishing
				Group. Shortly after the paperback, a hardback version was released that included a special
				edition of
				200 signed and numbered copies bound in asbestos.[50][51][52] These were technically
				collections
				because the novel was published with two short stories: The Playground and And the Rock Cried
				Out,
				which have been absent in later printings.[1][53] A few months later, the novel was serialized
				in the
				March, April, and May 1954 issues of nascent Playboy magazine.</p>

			<br>
			<font size="3">
				<h1><i>Reception</i></h2>
			</font>
			<hr color=black>
			<p>In 1954, Galaxy Science Fiction reviewer Groff Conklin placed the novel "among the great works
				of
				the imagination written in English in the last decade or more."[64] The Chicago Sunday
				Tribune's
				August Derleth described the book as "a savage and shockingly prophetic view of one possible
				future
				way of life", calling it "compelling" and praising Bradbury for his "brilliant
				imagination".[65] Over half
				a century later, Sam Weller wrote, "upon its publication, Fahrenheit 451 was hailed as a
				visionary work
				of social commentary."[66] Today, Fahrenheit 451 is still viewed as an important cautionary
				tale
				against conformity and book burning.</p>

			<p>When the book was first published, there were those who did not find merit in the tale. Anthony
				Boucher and J. Francis McComas were less enthusiastic, faulting the book for being "simply
				padded,
				occasionally with startlingly ingenious gimmickry, ... often with coruscating cascades of
				verbal
				brilliance [but] too often merely with words."[68] Reviewing the book for Astounding Science
				Fiction,
				P. Schuyler Miller characterized the title piece as "one of Bradbury's bitter, almost
				hysterical diatribes,"
				while praising its "emotional drive and compelling, nagging detail."[69] Similarly, The New
				York Times
				was unimpressed with the novel and further accused Bradbury of developing a "virulent hatred
				for
				many aspects of present-day culture, namely, such monstrosities as radio, TV, most movies,
				amateur
				and professional sports, automobiles, and other similar aberrations which he feels debase the
				bright
				simplicity of the thinking man's existence.</p>

			<br>
			<font size="3">
				<h1><i>Cultural references</i></h2>
			</font>
			<hr color=black>
			<p>Michael Moore's 2004 documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 refers to Bradbury's novel and the September
				11 attacks, emphasized by the film's tagline "The temperature where freedom burns". The film
				takes
				a critical look at the presidency of George W. Bush, the War on Terror, and its coverage in the
				news
				media, and became the highest grossing documentary of all time.[103] Bradbury was upset by what
				he considered the appropriation of his title, and wanted the film renamed.</p>

			<p>In 2015, the Internet Engineering Steering Group approved the publication of An HTTP Status Code
				to Report Legal Obstacles, now RFC 7725, which specifies that websites forced to block
				resources for
				legal reasons should return a status code of 451 when users request those resources.</p>

			<p>Centigrade 232 is a poem by Robert Calvert, published in a 1977 book and released as an album
				in 2007. The title alludes to Fahrenheit 451 by its metric equivalent, "signifying the writer
				destroying
				his rough drafts".</p>

			<p>In the book 14 of the Guardians of Ga'Hoole series by Kathryn Lasky, published in 2008, Braithe
				states that the name of the Place of Living Books, also called Brad, comes from an author's
				name :
				"The author's full name is not known. We call him Ray Brad. We think it's only scraps of his
				name but
				what is important is that he wrote about book burning." thus referencing Fahrenheit 451.</p>

			<br>
			<font size="3">
				<h1><i>Notes</i></h2>
			</font>
			<hr color=black>
			<ol>
				<li> During Captain Beatty's recounting of the history of the firemen to Montag, he says, "Out
					of the
					nursery into the college and back to the nursery; there's your intellectual pattern for the
					past five
					centuries or more." The text is ambiguous regarding which century he is claiming began this
					pattern.
					One interpretation is that he means the 20th century, which would place the novel in at
					least the 24th
					century. "The Fireman" novella, which was expanded to become Fahrenheit 451, is set in
					October 2052.
				<li>In early editions of the book, Montag says, "We've started and won two atomic wars since
					1960", in
					the first pages of The Sieve and the Sand. This sets a lower bound on the time setting. In
					later decades,
					some editions have changed this year to 1990 or 2022.
				<li>Clarisse tells Montag she is "seventeen and crazy", later admitting that she will actually
					be
					seventeen "next month".
				<li>"The Pedestrian" would go on to be published in The Reporter magazine on August 7, 1951,
					that is,
					after the publication in February 1951 of its inspired work "The Fireman".
