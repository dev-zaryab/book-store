			<h1><i>The Night Before St. Patrick's Day</i></h2>
		</font>
		<hr color=black>
		<font size="5"><b> Saint Patrick's Day</b>, or the <b>Feast of Saint Patrick</b> (Irish: L� Fh�ile P�draig,
			"the Day of the
			Festival of Patrick"), is a cultural and religious celebration held on 17 March, the traditional death date
			of Saint Patrick (c. AD 385�461), the foremost patron saint of Ireland.

			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<font size="3">
				<h1><i>Saint Patrick</i></h2>
			</font>
			<hr color=black>
			<p>APatrick was a 5th-century Romano-British Christian missionary and bishop in Ireland. Much of
				what is known about Saint Patrick comes from the Declaration, which was allegedly written by Patrick
				himself. It is believed that he was born in Roman Britain in the fourth century, into a wealthy Romano-
				British family. His father was a deacon and his grandfather was a priest in the Christian church.
				According to the Declaration, at the age of sixteen, he was kidnapped by Irish raiders and taken as a
				slave to Gaelic Ireland.[13] It says that he spent six years there working as a shepherd and that
				during
				this time he "found God". The Declaration says that God told Patrick to flee to the coast, where a ship
				would be waiting to take him home. After making his way home, Patrick went on to become a priest.</p>

				<h1><i>Celebrations by region</i></h2>
			</font>
			<hr color=black>
			<br>
			<b>Russia</b>
			<br>
			<p>The first St Patrick's Day parade took place in Russia in 1992.[58] Since 1999, there has been a yearly
				"Saint Patrick's Day" festival in Moscow and other Russian cities.[59] The official part of the Moscow
				parade is a military-style parade and is held in collaboration with the Moscow government and the
				Irish embassy in Moscow. The unofficial parade is held by volunteers and resembles a carnival. In 2014,
				Moscow Irish Week was celebrated from 12 to 23 March, which includes St Patrick's Day on 17 March.
				Over 70 events celebrating Irish culture in Moscow, St Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Voronezh, and
				Volgograd were sponsored by the Irish Embassy, the Moscow City Government, and other organisations.
			</p>

			<br>
			<b>Scotland</b>
			<p>The Scottish town of Coatbridge, where the majority of the town's population are of Irish descent,
				also has a Saint Patrick's Day Festival which includes celebrations and parades in the town centre.</p>

			<br>
			<b>Switzerland</b>
			<p>While Saint Patrick's Day in Switzerland is commonly celebrated on 17 March with festivities
				similar to those in neighbouring central European countries, it is not unusual for Swiss students to
				organise celebrations in their own living spaces on St Patrick's Eve. Most popular are usually those in
				Zurich's Kreis 4. Traditionally, guests also contribute with beverages and dress in green.</p>

			<br>
			<b>Japan</b>
			<p>St Patrick's Parades are now held in many locations across Japan. The first parade, in Tokyo, was
				organised by The Irish Network Japan (INJ) in 1992.</p>

			<br>
			<b>Korea</b>
			<p>The Irish Association of Korea has celebrated Saint Patrick's Day since 1976 in Seoul, the capital city
				of
				South Korea. The place of the parade and festival has been moved from Itaewon and Daehangno to
				Cheonggyecheon.</p>

			<br>
			<b>Malaysia</b>
			<p>In Malaysia, the St Patrick's Society of Selangor, founded in 1925, organises a yearly St Patrick's
				Ball, described as the biggest St Patrick's Day celebration in Asia. Guinness Anchor Berhad also
				organises 36 parties across the country in places like the Klang Valley, Penang, Johor Bahru, Malacca,
				Ipoh, Kuantan, Kota Kinabalu, Miri and Kuching.</p>

			<br>
			<b>Montserrat</b>
			<p>The tiny island of Montserrat is known as the "Emerald Island of the Caribbean" because of its
				founding by Irish refugees from Saint Kitts and Nevis. Montserrat is one of three places where St
				Patrick's Day is a public holiday, along with Ireland and the Canadian province of Newfoundland &
				Labrador. The holiday in Montserrat also commemorates a failed slave uprising that occurred on
				17 March 1768.</p>

				<h1><i>Criticism</i></h2>
			</font>
			<hr color=black>
			<p>In recent decades, St Patrick's Day celebrations have been criticised, particularly for their
				association with public drunkenness and disorderly conduct. Some argue that the festivities have
				become too commercialised and tacky, and have strayed from their original purpose of honouring St
				Patrick and Irish heritage. Journalist Niall O'Dowd has criticised recent attempts to recast St
				Patrick's
				Day as a celebration of multiculturalism rather than a celebration of Irishness.</p>
