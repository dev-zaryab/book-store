			<h1><i>Into the Wild</i></h2>
		</font>
		<hr color=black>
		<font size="5"><b>Into the Wild</b> is a 2007 American biographical survival film written, co-produced,
			and directed by Sean Penn. It is an adaptation of Jon Krakauer's 1996 nonfiction book of the same
			name, based on the travels of Christopher McCandless across North America and his experiences in the
			Alaskan wilderness in the early 1990s. The film stars Emile Hirsch as McCandless, and Marcia Gay
			Harden and William Hurt as his parents, and features Jena Malone, Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn,
			Kristen Stewart, and Hal Holbrook.
			<br>
			The film premiered during the 2007 Rome Film Fest and later opened outside Fairbanks, Alaska on
			September 21, 2007. It was nominated for two Golden Globes and won the award for Best Original
			Song: "Guaranteed" by Eddie Vedder. It was also nominated for two Academy Awards, namely Best
			Editing and Best Supporting Actor: Hal Holbrook.

			<br>
			<font size="3">
				<h1><i>Plot</i></h2>
			</font>
			<hr color=black>
			<p>The film is presented in a nonlinear narrative, cutting back and forth between McCandless' time
				spent in the Alaskan wilderness and his two-year travels leading up to his journey to Alaska. The plot
				summary here is told in a more chronological order.</p>

			<p>In April 1992, Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) arrives in a remote area just north of the
				Denali National Park and Preserve in Alaska. Noting Chris' unpreparedness, the stranger who drops
				him off lends him a pair of boots. Chris travels into the wilderness and sets up a campsite in an
				abandoned city bus, which he calls "The Magic Bus". At first, McCandless is content with the isolation,
				the beauty of nature around him, and the thrill of living off the land. He hunts with a .22 caliber
				rifle,
				reads books, and keeps a diary of his thoughts as he prepares himself for a new life in the wild.</p>

			<p>Two years earlier, in May 1990, McCandless graduates with high honors from Emory University.
				Shortly afterwards, McCandless rejects his conventional life by destroying all of his credit cards and
				identification documents. He donates nearly all of his savings to Oxfam and sets out on a cross-country
				drive in his Datsun B210 to experience life in the wilderness. McCandless does not tell his parents,
				Walt
				(William Hurt) and Billie McCandless (Marcia Gay Harden), or his sister Carine (Jena Malone) what he is
				doing or where he is going. He refuses to keep in touch with them after his departure, causing his
				parents to become increasingly anxious and eventually desperate.</p>

			<p>At Lake Mead, McCandless' car is caught in a flash flood, causing him to abandon it and begin
				hitchhiking. He burns what remains of his cash and assumes a new name: "Alexander Supertramp.
				" In Northern California, McCandless encounters a hippie couple named Jan Burres (Catherine Keener)
				and Rainey (Brian H. Dierker). Rainey tells McCandless about his failing relationship with Jan, which
				McCandless helps rekindle. In September, McCandless arrives in Carthage, South Dakota and works for
				a contract harvesting company owned by Wayne Westerberg (Vince Vaughn). He is forced to leave
				after Westerberg is arrested for satellite piracy.</p>

			<p>McCandless then travels on the Colorado River and, though told by park rangers that he may not
				kayak down the river without a license, ignores their warnings and paddles downriver until he
				eventually arrives in Mexico. There, his kayak is lost in a dust storm, and he crosses back into the
				United States on foot. Unable to hitch a ride, he starts traveling on freight trains to Los Angeles.
				Not
				long after arriving, however, he starts feeling "corrupted" by modern civilization and decides to
				leave.
				Later, McCandless is forced to resume hitchhiking, after he is beaten by the railroad police.</p>

				<h1><i>Production</i></h2>
			</font>
			<hr color=black>
			<font size="5"><b>Fliming</b>
				<p>The scenes of graduation from Emory University in the film were shot in the fall of 2006 on the
					front lawn of Reed College. Some of the graduation scenes were also filmed during the actual Emory
					University graduation on May 15, 2006.[5] The Alaska scenes depicting the area around the abandoned
					bus on the Stampede Trail were filmed 50 miles (80 km) south of where McCandless actually died, in
					the tiny town of Cantwell. Filming at the actual bus would have been too remote for the technical
					demands of a movie shoot.[6] A replica bus used in the movie is now a tourist attraction at a
					restaurant
					in Healy, Alaska.</p>
