				<h1><i>The Handmaid's Tale</i></h2>
			</font>
			<hr color=black>
			<font size="5">
				<p><b> The Handmaid's Tale </b> is a dystopian novel by Canadian author Margaret
					Atwood, originally published in 1985. It is set in a near-future New England, in a totalitarian,
					Christian
					theonomy that has overthrown the United States government.[5] The novel focuses on the journey of
					the handmaid Offred. Her name derives from the possessive form "of Fred"; handmaids are forbidden
					to use their birth names and must echo the male, or master, whom they serve.</p>

				<p><i>The Handmaid's Tale</i> explores themes of women in subjugation to misogyny in a patriarchal
					society and the various means by which these women gain individualism and independence. The novel's
					title echoes the component parts of Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales, which is a series of
					connected stories ("The Merchant's Tale", "The Parson's Tale", etc.).</p>

				<p><i>The Handmaid's Tale</i>is structured into two parts, night and other various events. This novel
					can be interpreted as a double narrative, Offred's tale and the handmaids' tales. The night
					sections are
					solely about Offred, and the other sections (shopping, waiting room, household, etc.) are the
					stories
					that describe the possible life of every handmaid, though from the perspective of Offred. In many
					of the
					se sections, Offred jumps between past and present as she retells the events leading up to the fall
					of
					women's rights and the current details of the life which she now lives.</p>

				<p><i>The Handmaid's Tale</i>won the 1985 Governor General's Award and the first Arthur C.
					Clarke Award in 1987; it was also nominated for the 1986 Nebula Award, the 1986 Booker Prize, and
					the 1987 Prometheus Award. The book has been adapted into a 1990 film, a 2000 opera, a television
					series, and other media.</p>


				<br>
				<font size="3">
					<h1><i>Plot summary</i></h2>
				</font>
				<hr color=black>
				<p><i>The Handmaid's Tale</i> is set in the Republic of Gilead, a theonomic military dictatorship
					formed within the borders of what was formerly the United States of America.</p>

				<p>Beginning with a staged attack that kills the President and most of Congress, a fundamentalist
					Christian Reconstructionist movement calling itself the "Sons of Jacob" launches a revolution and
					suspends the United States Constitution under the pretext of restoring order.They quickly remove
					women's
					rights, largely attributed to financial records being stored electronically and labelled by sex.
					The new
					regime, the Republic of Gilead, moves quickly to consolidate its power, including overtaking all
					pre-existing religious groups, including Christianity, and reorganize society along a new
					militarized,
					hierarchical model of Old Testament-inspired social and religious fanaticism among its newly
					created
					social classes. In this society, human rights are severely limited and women's rights are strictly
					curtailed. For example, women are forbidden to read, and anyone caught in homosexual acts would be
					hanged for "Gender Treachery"</p>

				<p>The story is told in the first person by a woman called Offred. The character is one of a class of
					women kept for reproductive purposes and known as "handmaids" by the ruling class in an era of
					declining births due to sterility from pollution and sexually transmitted diseases. Offred
					describes her
					life during her third assignment as a handmaid, in this case to Fred (referred to as "The
					Commander").
					Interspersed in flashbacks are portions of her life from before and during the beginning of the
					revolution,
					when she finds she has lost all autonomy to her husband, their failed escape attempt to Canada, and
					finally her indoctrination into life as a handmaid by government-trained women called the Aunts.
				</p>

				<p>Offred describes the structure of Gilead's society, including the different classes of women and
					their
					lives within the new theonomy. The women are physically segregated by colour of clothing�blue, red,
					green, striped and white - to signify social class and assigned position, ranked highest to lowest.
					The
					Commanders' wives are dressed in blue, handmaids in red, Marthas (cooks and maids) in green, and
					striped is for the lower class women who essentially do everything in the domestic sphere. Young
					girls
					are dressed in white.</p>

				<p>It is assumed that Offred survived and that the Eyes that collected her were, in fact, part of
					Mayday
					as her cassette tapes contain parts of the story that would have been impossible to tape if she had
					not
					escaped. Nevertheless, the epilogue implies that, following the collapse of the theonomic Republic
					of
					Gilead, a more equal society�though not the United States that previously existed�re-emerged, with
					a
					restoration of full rights for women and freedom of religion.</p>

				<br>
				<font size="3">
					<h1><i>Characters</i></h2>
				</font>
				<hr color=black>
				<b>Offred</b>
				<p>Offred is the protagonist and narrator. She was labeled a "wanton woman" when Gilead was
					established because she had married a man who was divorced. All divorces were nullified by the new
					government, meaning her husband was now considered still married to his first wife, making Offred
					an adulteress. In trying to escape Gilead, she was separated from her husband and daughter. She is
					part of the first generation of Gilead's women, those who remember pre-Gilead times. Proved
					fertile,
					she is considered an important commodity and has been placed as a handmaid in the home of the
					Commander Fred and his wife Serena Joy, to bear a child for them (Serena Joy is believed to be
					infertile).</p>

				<p>Offred is a slave name that describes her function: she is "of Fred", i.e. she belongs to Fred, her
					commander, and is considered a concubine. In the novel, Offred says that she is not a concubine,
					but a
					tool; a "two legged womb". The Handmaids' names say nothing about who the women really are
					(Offred Of Fred, Ofglen Of Glen); their only identity is as the Commander's property. "Offred" is
					also a
					pun on the word "offered", as in "offered as a sacrifice," as well as a play on the words
					"off-red",
					referencing the color that handmaids wear and the character's frustrations with her assigned
					position.
				</p>

				<p>The women in training to be handmaids whisper names across their beds at night. The names are
					"Alma. Janine. Dolores. Moira. June", and all are later accounted for except June. In addition, one
					of the
					Aunts tells the handmaids-in-training to stop "mooning and June-ing".[10] From this and other
					references,
					some readers have inferred that her birth name could be "June". Miner suggests that "June" is a
					pseudonym. As "Mayday" is the name of the Gilead resistance, June could be an invention by the
					protagonist. The Nunavit conference covered in the epilogue takes place in June. When the Hulu
					TV series chose to state outright that Offred's real name is June, Atwood wrote that it was not her
					original intention to imply that Offred's real name is June "but it fits, so readers are welcome to
					it if
					they wish.</p>

				<b>The Commander</b>
				<p>The Commander says that he is a sort of scientist and was previously involved in something similar
					to market research, pre-Gilead. Later, it is hypothesized, but not confirmed, that he might have
					been
					one of the architects of the Republic and its laws. Presumably, his first name is "Fred", though
					that, too,
					may be a pseudonym.</p>

				<p>He engages in forbidden intellectual pursuits with Offred, such as playing Scrabble, and introduces
					her to a secret club that serves as a brothel for high-ranking officers. Offred learns that the
					Commander
					carried on a similar relationship with his previous handmaid and that she killed herself when his
					wife
					found out. In the epilogue the academics speculate that one of two figures, both instrumental in
					the
					establishment of Gilead, may have been Fred, based on his first name. It is strongly suggested that
					the
					Commander was a man named Frederick R. Waterford who was killed in a purge shortly after Offred
					was taken away, charged with harboring an enemy agent.</p>

				<b>Ofglen</b>
				<p>Ofglen is a neighbour of Offred's and a fellow Handmaid. She is partnered with Offred to do the
					daily shopping. Handmaids are never alone and are expected to police each other's behaviour. Ofglen
					is a member of the Mayday resistance. In contrast to Offred, she is daring. She knocks out a Mayday
					spy who is to be tortured and killed in order to save him the pain of a violent death. Offred is
					told that
					when Ofglen vanishes, it is because she has committed suicide before the government can take her
					into
					custody due to her membership in the resistance, possibly to avoid giving away any information.
				<p>

				<p>A new handmaid, also called Ofglen, takes Ofglen's place, and is assigned as Offred's
					shopping
					partner. She threatens Offred against any thought of resistance. She breaks protocol by
					telling her
					what happened to the first Ofglen.</p>

				<b>Nick</b>
				<p>Nick is the Commander's chauffeur, who lives above the garage. By Serena Joy's arrangement,
					he
					and Offred start a sexual relationship to increase her chance of getting pregnant. If she
					were unable to
					bear the Commander a child, she would be declared sterile and shipped to the ecological
					wastelands of
					the Colonies. Offred begins to develop feelings for him. Nick is an ambiguous character,
					and Offred
					does not know if he is a party loyalist or part of the resistance, though he identifies
					himself as the
					former. The epilogue suggests that he really was part of the resistance, and aided Offred
					in escaping
					the Commander's house.</p>

				<br>
				<font size="3">
					<h1><i>Setting</i></h2>
				</font>
				<hr color=black>
				<p>The novel is set in an indeterminate future, speculated to be around the year 2005,with a
					fundamentalist theonomy ruling the territory of what had been the United States but is now
					the
					Republic of Gilead. Individuals are segregated by categories and dressed according to their
					social
					functions. The complex sumptuary laws (dress codes) play a key role in imposing social
					control within
					the new society and serve to distinguish people by sex, occupation, and caste.</p>

				<p>The action takes place in what once was the Harvard Square neighbourhood of Cambridge,
					Massachusetts; Atwood studied at Radcliffe College, located in this area.</p>

				<br>
				<font size="3">
					<h1><i>Critical reception</i></h2>
				</font>
				<hr color=black>
				<p>The Handmaid's Tale was well received by critics, helping to cement Atwood's status as a
					prominent writer of the 20th century. Not only was the book deemed well-written and
					compelling, but
					Atwood's work was notable for sparking intense debates both in and out of academia.Atwood
					maintains
					that the Republic of Gilead is only an extrapolation of trends already seen in the United
					States at the
					time of her writing, a view supported by other scholars studying The Handmaid's Tale.[36]
					Indeed,
					many have placed The Handmaid's Tale in the same category of dystopian fiction as Nineteen
					Eighty-Four
					and Brave New World,[31] with the added feature of confronting patriarchy, a categorization
					that
					Atwood has accepted and reiterated in many articles and interviews.</p>

				<p>Even today, many reviewers hold that Atwood's novel remains as foreboding and powerful as
					ever,
					largely because of its basis in historical fact.[38][39] Yet when her book was first
					published in 1985, not
					all reviewers were convinced of the "cautionary tale" Atwood presented. For example, Mary
					McCarthy's
					New York Times review argued that The Handmaid's Tale lacked the "surprised recognition"
					necessary
					for readers to see "our present selves in a distorting mirror, of what we may be turning
					into if current
					trends are allowed to continue".</p>

				<p>In the aftermath of the television series' debut in 2017, there was much debate on whether
					parallels
					could be drawn between the series (and by extension, this book) and American society
					following Donald
					Trump's and Mike Pence's election as President of the United States and Vice President of
					the United
					States, respectively.</p>
