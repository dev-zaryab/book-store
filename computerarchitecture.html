		<font size="5">In computer engineering,<b> computer architecture </b> is a set of rules and methods
			that describe the functionality, organization, and implementation of computer systems. Some definitions
			of architecture define it as describing the capabilities and programming model of a computer but not
			a particular implementation. In other definitions computer architecture involves instruction set
			architecture design, microarchitecture design, logic design, and implementation.

			<br>
			<br>

				<h1><i>History</i></h2>
			</font>
			<hr color=black>
			<p>The first documented computer architecture was in the correspondence between Charles Babbage
				and Ada Lovelace, describing the analytical engine. When building the computer Z1 in 1936, Konrad
				Zuse described in two patent applications for his future projects that machine instructions could be
				stored in the same storage used for data, i.e. the stored-program concept.[3][4] Two other early and
				important examples are:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>John von Neumann's 1945 paper, First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC, which described an
					organization of logical elements; and
				<li>Alan Turing's more detailed Proposed Electronic Calculator for the Automatic Computing Engine, also
					1945 and which cited John von Neumann's paper.
			</ul>

			<b>Definition</b>
			<p>The purpose is to design a computer that maximizes performance while keeping power consumption
				in check, costs low relative to the amount of expected performance, and is also very reliable. For
				this,
				many aspects are to be considered which includes instruction set design, functional organization, logic
				design, and implementation. The implementation involves integrated circuit design, packaging, power,
				and cooling. Optimization of the design requires familiarity with compilers, operating systems to logic
				design, and packaging.</p>

			<br>
			<b>Computer organization</b>
			<p>Computer organization helps optimize performance-based products. For example, software engineers
				need to know the processing power of processors. They may need to optimize software in order to gain
				the most performance for the lowest price. This can require quite detailed analysis of the computer's
				organization. For example, in a SD card, the designers might need to arrange the card so that the most
				data can be processed in the fastest possible way.</p>

			<br>
			<b>Implementation</b>
			<p>Once an instruction set and micro-architecture are designed, a practical machine must be developed.
				This design process is called the implementation. Implementation is usually not considered
				architectural
				design, but rather hardware design engineering. Implementation can be further broken down into
				several steps:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Logic Implementation </b>designs the circuits required at a logic gate level
				<li><b>Circuit Implementation </b>does transistor-level designs of basic elements (gates, multiplexers,
					latches etc.) as well as of some larger blocks (ALUs, caches etc.) that may be implemented at the
					log gate level, or even at the physical level if the design calls for it.
				<li><b>Physical Implementation </b>draws physical circuits. The different circuit components are placed
					in a chip floorplan or on a board and the wires connecting them are created.
				<li><b>Design Validation </b>tests the computer as a whole to see if it works in all situations and all
					timings. Once the design validation process starts, the design at the logic level are tested using
					logic emulators. However, this is usually too slow to run realistic test. So, after making
					corrections based on the first test, prototypes are constructed using Field-Programmable
					Gate-Arrays (FPGAs). Most hobby projects stop at this stage. The final step is to test prototype
					integrated circuits. Integrated circuits may require several redesigns to fix problems.
			</ul>
