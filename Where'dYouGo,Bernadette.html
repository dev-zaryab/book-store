			<h1><i>Where'd You Go, Bernadette</i></h2>
		</font>
		<hr color=black>
		<font size="5"><b>Where'd You Go, Bernadette</b> is a 2012 comedy novel written by Maria Semple.
			The plot revolves around an agoraphobic architect and mother named Bernadette Fox, who goes
			missing prior to a family trip to Antarctica. It is narrated by her 15-year-old daughter Bee Branch. It is
			told in a series of documents (emails, memos, transcripts, etc.) with the occasional interlude by Bee.

			<br>
			<font size="3">
				<h1><i>Synopsis</i></h2>
			</font>
			<hr color=black>
			<p>After her mother's disappearance, 15-year-old Bee Branch gathers correspondence relating to her
				mother in order to ascertain what has happened to her. Bee traces the incident back to her perfect
				report card. Earlier, Bee's parents had told her she could have anything she wanted if she got a
				perfect
				report card for all her years in this school. Because of this previous promise, Bee convinces her
				parents,
				stay at home mother Bernadette, and father Elgin, a genius who works at Microsoft, to take her to
				Antarctica. Though Bernadette is mostly housebound she delegates the task of making their arrangements
				to a personal assistant in India, Manjula.</p>

			<p>Because she is housebound, Bernadette has an ongoing feud with some of the mothers at Bee's
				private school with the main instigator being her neighbor Audrey Griffin. Audrey accuses Bernadette
				of running over her foot with her car (which Bernadette does not dispute, though it is untrue).</p>

			<p>Bee also learns that her mother was once a famous architect, winner of a MacArthur "Genius"
				Grant because of her creation of the 20 Mile house, so called because it was made from material sourced
				from within 20 miles of the home. After she won the grant, Bernadette sold the house, only to belatedly
				realize it had been sold to a hostile neighbour who demolished the home as soon as he obtained it.
				After the defeat Bernadette moved to Seattle where she had four miscarriages before Bee.</p>

			<p>A friend of Audrey's, Soo-Lin Lee-Segal, an admin at Microsoft, goes to work for Elgin Branch. She
				reveals to him Bernadette's "attacks" on Audrey, causing him to question whether to admit Bernadette
				to a psychiatric institution. As Soo-Lin and Elgin begin an emotional affair, the FBI also contact
				Elgin to
				reveal "Manjula" is actually a Russian money scamming ring who plan to defraud Elgin and Bernadette
				Elgin arranges for an intervention with Bernadette at the dentist to reveal these facts to her, but
				because of a mistake the (unsuccessful) intervention happens at their home with the FBI and police
				involved. In the middle of the intervention Bernadette goes to the washroom and disappears.</p>

			<p>In the aftermath of Bernadette's disappearance Bee is sent to Choate early and Soo-Lin reveals to
				Audrey that she is pregnant with Elgin's child and he has bought them a family home. Elgin and Soo-
				Lin learn that Bernadette did take the trip to Antarctica herself and go there to confront her only to
				have her disappear again. During this time Soo-Lin also reveals to Audrey that her life is miserable
				and that the pregnancy is a result of a drunken one night stand between her and Elgin, who completely
				regrets the incident.</p>

			<p>At Choate, Bee receives a package that contains the bulk of the correspondence used in the novel
				up to that point. It is revealed that after discovering that the accusations she levelled against
				Bernadette
				were going to result in her being hospitalized, Audrey helped her escape from her house, showed her
				all the correspondence between Soo-Lin and her husband, stayed silent when Bernadette decided to go
				to Antarctica in the hopes that she would be able to speak privately to Elgin and Bee there, and sent
				the
				package containing all the correspondence to Bee, in the hopes that Bee would understand what
				happened with Bernadette.</p>

			<p>Bee is kicked out of Choate, in part because of the manuscript she is putting together. She guilts her
				father into going on the trip to Antarctica with her in the name of closure though she secretly
				believes
				her mother is still alive and hiding there. After nearly giving up hope Bee learns of Palmer Station,
				an
				American base where scientists work and research. Stealing a boat with her father, Bee goes to the
				station where she in fact finds Bernadette who is surprised to find that her family thought she was
				dead as she sent Bee a letter.</p>

			<p>Bee finds the missing letter when she returns to her old school. The letter reveals that Bernadette
				went to Antarctica in the hopes of reconciling with her husband and daughter and decided to stay for
				the cruise. While there she met a scientist who told her about Palmer Station and an architectural
				project for the south pole in which every single material would have to be shipped from the U.S. which
				meant that it was of the utmost importance for everything to be designed to complete perfection.
				Bernadette snuck on board Palmer Station hoping to work on the project and sent the letter to Bee
				asking for her blessing and telling her she would return home if she did not get it within a set period
				of time.</p>
